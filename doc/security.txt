A Group is a bunch of members grouped into a patrol, six, crew, whatever

Everyone can view their own record, and the records for everyone else in their Section.
Everyone can record progress, but not sign off, their own record.
GlobalView can view all records, but not edit
SectionLeader is head of a Section, can manage groups for that Section, assign members to groups,
  view, record, and sign off progress of all scouts in that Section
GroupLeader is someone who is a leader of a group they are a member of, and can enter and
  can record progress for members of that group.  Query - can they sign stuff off?

MemberAdmin can add new scouts
UserAdmin can manage logins
SiteAdmin is super set of all others

Currently only SiteAdmin can manage Badges and Events, need to ponder this
